HIGH PRIORITY:
Why does total sync time decrease with large syncs? Use netstat to see if all data is actually being transferred
	in <client>/daemon/repo-mgr.c, handle_add_files() there is code that checks for commit size over the MAX_COMMIT_SIZE, see if this is why syncs get "faster" when the files get too large. These are called "partial commits" with a max size of 100M at a time, then it starts uploading again but each time acts as if the sync has finished. This explains the shorter sync times with large files.
	new nginx setting proxy_request_buffering off; might have fixed this


Fixed MAX_COMMIT_SIZE issue by replacing all instances of "if (*total_size >= MAX_COMMIT_SIZE)" with "if (0)"



Re-test updated scripts on clean virtual machines




Make sure scripts produce test data in easy to interpret format - hunt down scripts that sum output and use this to produce a nice output file
	In sum-*.sh scripts, remove -free.txt etc. from output before printing to *-list.txt

Make sure spreadsheet has up-to-date test data




===Produce digital documentation of seafile client upload/sync process (already documented in book)





RE-GENERATE DOXYGEN OUTPUT ONCE CODE IS FINALIZED




LOW PRIORITY:
Merge all apt-get install commands into one go for each computer
Allow user to set number of files & sizes to test with automated-test.sh (also nesting depth etc?)
What does seafile-applet do if there's no GUI? Does it work without X installed?
	on c158: <list apt packages> | grep "desktop"
Better looking formatting for seafile-summary.odt (e.g. monospace font for code & paths)
is iptables opening ports on server actually needed? Probably is, can't hurt.


#DUET CHECKOUT INSTRUCTIONS:
