HIGH PRIORITY:
what are partial commits?

Why does total sync time decrease with large syncs? Use netstat to see if all data is actually being transferred
	in <client>/daemon/repo-mgr.c, handle_add_files() there is code that checks for commit size over the MAX_COMMIT_SIZE, see if this is why syncs get "faster" when the files get too large
	new nginx setting proxy_request_buffering off; might fix this

Automate client setup
	Automatically find or set seafile library id (detect on server and print then manually enter on client?)
	Ask for server IP, username, password used in seahub setup
	Permanently export these as environment variables, use them in all the test scripts (including SF-server-remote-restart.exp)
	Update all scripts using c157.exp to use SF-server-remote-restart.exp

Put test scripts into TestScripts folder in duet/SeaFileClient & duet/SeaFileServer as relevant
Put install scripts into SeaFileServer and SeaFileClient folders respectively

Why is first run of $SEAFILEDIR/TestScripts/SF-server-remote-restart.exp commented out in sync-and-time-profile.sh and -log.sh ?

Make sure spreadsheet has up-to-date test data
	Make sure scripts produce test data in easy to interpret format - hunt down scripts that sum output and use this to produce a nice output file
Outline how exactly a sync-test works & document how to use scripts
	How to generate gprof output on c158
Check if sync-and-time-profile.sh is deprecated due to mygmon.<pid> files
Produce digital documentation of seafile client upload/sync process (already documented in book)

TEST THAT INSTALL & TEST SCRIPTS ALL WORK ON CLEAN UBUNTU INSTALLS ON C20 VMs
RE-GENERATE DOXYGEN OUTPUT ONCE CODE IS FINALIZED




LOW PRIORITY:
Allow user to set number of files & sizes to test with automated-test.sh (also nesting depth etc?)
What does seafile-applet do if there's no GUI? Does it work without X installed?
Better looking formatting for seafile-summary.odt (e.g. monospace font for code & paths)
is iptables opening ports on server actually needed? Probably


#DUET CHECKOUT INSTRUCTIONS:

git clone https://github.com/gamvrosi/duet.git
# switch branch to seafile
git checkout seafile
# list branches, if correctly in seafile it will have an asterisk
git branch
