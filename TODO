HIGH PRIORITY:
Why does total sync time decrease with large syncs? Use netstat to see if all data is actually being transferred
	in <client>/daemon/repo-mgr.c, handle_add_files() there is code that checks for commit size over the MAX_COMMIT_SIZE, see if this is why syncs get "faster" when the files get too large. These are called "partial commits" with a max size of 100M at a time, then it starts uploading again but each time acts as if the sync has finished. This explains the shorter sync times with large files.
	new nginx setting proxy_request_buffering off; might have fixed this

Put test scripts into TestScripts folder in duet/SeaFileClient & duet/SeaFileServer as relevant
Put install scripts into SeaFileServer and SeaFileClient folders respectively

Unfinished scripts:
	SF-server-nginx-setup.sh			needs to output library id
	sync-and-time-profile.sh, -log.sh	need to be merged


TEST THAT INSTALL & TEST SCRIPTS ALL WORK ON CLEAN UBUNTU INSTALLS ON C20 VMs
	Run SF-server-build-install.sh on server VM & SF-client-build-install.sh on client VM, find library ID on server, see if this works with SF-client

Make sure spreadsheet has up-to-date test data
	Make sure scripts produce test data in easy to interpret format - hunt down scripts that sum output and use this to produce a nice output file
	
Outline how exactly a sync-test works & document how to use scripts
	How to generate gprof output on client
		Check if sync-and-time-profile.sh is deprecated due to mygmon.<pid> files
		Merge sync-and-time-profile and -log because they are the same core process

===Produce digital documentation of seafile client upload/sync process (already documented in book)





RE-GENERATE DOXYGEN OUTPUT ONCE CODE IS FINALIZED




LOW PRIORITY:
Allow user to set number of files & sizes to test with automated-test.sh (also nesting depth etc?)
What does seafile-applet do if there's no GUI? Does it work without X installed?
	on c158: <list apt packages> | grep "desktop"
Better looking formatting for seafile-summary.odt (e.g. monospace font for code & paths)
is iptables opening ports on server actually needed? Probably is, can't hurt.


#DUET CHECKOUT INSTRUCTIONS:

git clone https://github.com/gamvrosi/duet.git
# switch branch to seafile
git checkout seafile
# list branches, if correctly in seafile it will have an asterisk
git branch
